# CBC Datawrapper scripts

These scripts are used to automatically update several charts for CBC News.

## COVID-19 charts
These charts pull in data from the Public Health Agency of Canada and update live charts for most provinces and regions in Canada every Monday-Friday at 9:30 AM EST.

## Ukraine battle map
This map takes points from a Google sheet updated by CBC journalists and populates a map for use in stories about the war in Ukraine.
