# CBC Datawrapper scripts

These scripts are used to automatically update several charts for CBC News, and rely on [a module called datawrappergraphics](https://github.com/dexmcmillan/datawrappergraphics) that is a Pythonic representation of each graphic.

## Maps using this module

### Ukraine battle map
Active  
[This map](https://www.datawrapper.de/_/sM21M/) takes points from a Google sheet updated by CBC journalists and populates a map for use in stories about the war in Ukraine.

### Eastern Ukraine battle map
Active
[This map](https://www.datawrapper.de/_/PsIWk/) is same as above, but focused on Eastern Ukraine, and includes shapefiles from maps showing the Russian advance into Ukraine.

### Ontario road map
Active
An [automatically updating map](https://www.datawrapper.de/_/RHK8m/) that uses Ontario 511 data to plot road closures onto a CBC-branded map. A script keeps this updated every hour.

### Ontario polling graphics

Created as a backup to a CBC Newslabs presentation. These graphics have moved to [a new repository](https://github.com/dexmcmillan/cbc-polling-graphics).
